# Lanham Lab Seven
 
 This is a test for lab Seven.

My name is Lauren Lanham, and I am studying Biosystems Engineering. I have been using GitHub since January for Lab assignments. While using the platform, I have noticed some differences. Git is more of a standalone tool that is really helpful for version control. Github is cloud based and it the best for collaboration. Lastly, the desktop app might be more suited for beginners because you don't have to know Git commands. Overall, each part of the platform has its own benedits and it is best for the user to analyze what they need before choosing which platform to work in.
